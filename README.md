## Quick start
Open [Train Scheduler](https://victoire44.github.io/Train-Scheduler/) in your browser.

## Presentation
The purpose of this assignment is to create a Train scheduler.<br>
I use [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) to store the train data. 
<br>
When you complete the form and submit it, a new row appears in a table. 
It displays the Train Name, the Destination, the Frequency in minutes and calculates:
* the time at which the next train will departs, in function of the current time
* the remaining minutes before the next train.
<br>
For these calculations, I use [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/)

<br>
When the Frequency or First Train Time inputs are not completed, the "Next Arrival" and "Minutes Away" columns are mark Unknown. 
<br>
It's possible to delete the row by clicking on the cross.
